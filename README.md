**Intelligent Vehicle Damage Assessment & Cost Estimator for Insurance Companies Using IBM Cloud**

Nowadays, a lot of money is being wasted in the car insurance business due to leakage claims.
Claims leakage /Underwriting leakage is characterized as the discrepancy between the actual 
payment of claims made and the sum that should have been paid if all of the industry's leading 
practices were applied. Visual examination and testing have been used to may these results.
However, they impose delays in the processing of claims. 

The aim of this project is to build a VGG16 model that can detect the area of damage on a car.
The relation for such a model is that it can be used by insurance companies for faster processing 
of claims if users can upload pics and the model  can assess damage( be it dent scratch  from and
estimates the cost of damage. This model can also be used by lenders if they are underwriting a car
loan especially for a used car.
